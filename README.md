# ML_classification_titanic
Here the training set from the `Titanic: Machine learning from Disaster` from Kaggle was used to perform:

- Data exploratory analysis

- Feature engineering

- Evaluating classifiers:
  * Strategy definition
  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1 scores

- Hyperparameters optimization using Exhaustive search over specified parameters for estimators (GridSearchCV):
  * Logistic Regression
  * RandomForestClassifier: A meta estimator  to fit a n number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset
  * Support Vector Machines
  * K neighbors
  * Gradient Boosting
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis

- How different ML models perform on unseen data: Predicting on the test data.
